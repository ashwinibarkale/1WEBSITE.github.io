          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="special-paragraph">
            HHello, I'm Ashwini Barkale, a 23-year-old from Pune. Let me share a bit about my journey. I began in IT, completing my BCA in 2021 with the intention of pursuing an MBA due to my passion for HR. However, due to some circumstances, I ended up opting for an MCA instead. Despite this, my heart has always been set on HR. Even though I did two internships in web development, my true passion lies in HR. I have a genuine love for HR - it's not just a random choice. While I found coding interesting, I feel most fulfilled when helping others grow. So, despite some questioning my move from IT to HR, I'm confident in my decision. HR isn't just a job for me; it's where I believe I can make a real difference, where I belong, and where I find my purpose. </p>
