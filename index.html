          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="special-paragraph">
            Hey buddy, it's Ashwini Barkale. Hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something important with you.
             You see, after finishing my Bachelor's in Computer Applications in 2021 and then my Master's in 2023, I realized 
             something about myself. Sure, I learned a lot about computers and web development during my studies and internships. 
             But deep down, what really excites me is working with people, not just machines. That's why I've been thinking about 
             Human Resources, or HR. It's all about understanding people's needs, helping them grow, and making sure everyone feels
              happy and valued at work. It's like being the glue that holds a company together, and that idea really resonates with me. 
              So, even though some people might expect me to pursue something like an
             MBA, I'm more drawn to HR because it aligns with my passion for helping others succeed. </p>
